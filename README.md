# Game of Life

Coding challenge for TuneIn by Ethan Miller.

## Instructions

Download the code and make sure you run `npm install`. Then, run the game using `npm start`. The size of the game board and number of iterations can be configured using `appConfig.ts`. A couple of basic tests are included which can be run using `npm test`.
